\chapter{STORAGE\_BACKEND}
\lstinline;STORAGE_BACKEND; provides a unified interface for different storage
methods an archive could use. Currently the only implementation is
\lstinline;FILE_STORAGE_BACKEND;, providing support for archives that are stored
in a file.

\section{FILE\_STORAGE\_BACKEND}
A \lstinline;FILE_STORAGE_BACKEND; is either created from a file with
\lstinline;make_from_file; or from a filename with
\lstinline;make_from_filename;.

\section{Implementing a Custom STORAGE\_BACKEND}
To implement a custom \lstinline;STORAGE_BACKEND;, one has to implement the
following features:

\subsection{Creation Procedures}
If \lstinline;default_create; is redefined, \lstinline;Precursor; must be
called. Every other creation procedure should call \lstinline;default_create;.

\subsection{open\_read}
\lstinline;open_read;\\
Open backend for read access. Reading should start from the beginning.

\subsection{open\_write}
\lstinline;open_write;\\
Open backend for write access. Writing should start from the beginning.

\subsection{close}
\lstinline;close;\\
Close backend.

\subsection{archive\_finished}
\lstinline;archive_finished: BOOLEAN;\\
Indicate whether the next two blocks contain the end-of-archive indicator
(only zero bytes). The next \lstinline;read_block; calls should not skip these
two blocks but read them again (not necessarily from the backend again, the
implementation is free to chache these blocks).
\lstinline;archive_finished; should return \lstinline;True; too, if an error
occured (or occurs while checking for the end-of-archive indicator), does not
have enough blocks available or if the backend is closed.

\subsection{block\_ready}
\lstinline;block_ready: BOOLEAN;\\
Indicate whether there is a block that can be read with \lstinline;last_block;
\lstinline;False; if an error occured.


\subsection{is\_readable}
\lstinline;is_readable: BOOLEAN;\\
Indicates whether this backend can be read from. If an error occured, this has
to return \lstinline;False;

\subsection{is\_writable}
\lstinline;is_writable: BOOLEAN;\\
Indicates whether this backend can be written to. If an error occured, this has
to return \lstinline;False;

\subsection{is\_closed}
\lstinline;is_closed: BOOLEAN;\\
Indicates whether this backend is closed.

\subsection{read\_block}
\lstinline;read_block;\\
Read next block from backend. If there are not enough bytes for a full block, an
error should be reported.

\subsection{last\_block}
\lstinline;last_block: MANAGED_POINTER;\\
Last block that was read.

\subsection{write\_block}
\lstinline;write_block (block: MANAGED_POINTER);\\
Write \lstinline;block; to the backend (starting from the beginning).

\subsection{finalize}
\lstinline;finalize;\\
Write the end-of-archive indicator and close backend.
